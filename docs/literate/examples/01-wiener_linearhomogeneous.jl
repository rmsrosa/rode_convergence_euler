# # Homogenous linear RODE with a Wiener process noise coefficient
#
# We start by considering a homogeneous linear equation in which the coefficient is a Wiener process. In this case, it is already know, by other means, that the Euler method converges strongly of order 1, because it can be regarded as system of stochastic differential equations with additive noise. Nevertheless, we use it here for illustrative purposes.

# ## The equation

# We consider the RODE
# ```math
#   \begin{cases}
#     \displaystyle \frac{\mathrm{d}X_t}{\mathrm{d} t} = W_t X_t, \qquad 0 \leq t \leq T, \\
#   \left. X_t \right|_{t = 0} = X_0,
#   \end{cases}
# ```
# where $\{W_t\}_{t\geq 0}$ is a standard Wiener process.
# The explicit solution is
# ```math
#   X_t = e^{\int_0^t W_s \;\mathrm{d}s} X_0.
# ```

# ## Computing a solution with the exact distribution

# The integral $\int_0^{t_j} W_s\;\mathrm{d}s$ and, hence, the exact solution, is not uniquely defined from the values $W_{t_j}$ of the noise on the mesh points, no matter how fine it is. Hence, it makes no sense to compute the strong distance to "the exact solution". But we can estimate that by drawing sample solutions with the exact distribution conditioned on the mesh values.
# 
# We do that by first breaking down the sum into parts:
# ```math
# \int_0^{t_j} W_s\;\mathrm{d}s = \sum_{i = 0}^{j-1} \int_{t_i}^{t_{i+1}} W_s\;\mathrm{d}s.
# ```
# 
# On each mesh interval, we use that
# ```math
#   B_t = W_t - W_{t_i} - \frac{t - t_i}{t_{i+1}-t_i}(W_{t_{i+1}} - W_{t_i})
# ```
# is a Brownian bridge on $[t_i, t_{i+1}]$, independent of $W_{t_i}$ and $W_{t_{i+1}}$.
# 
# Since
# ```math
#   \mathrm{d}W_t = \mathrm{d}B_t + \frac{W_{t_{i+1}}-W_{t_i}}{t_{i+1}-t_i}\;\mathrm{d}t,
# ```
# we obtain
# ```math
# \begin{align*}
#   \int_{t_i}^{t_{i+1}} W_s\;\mathrm{d}s & = \int_{t_i}^{t_{i+1}} B_s^i\;\mathrm{d}s + \int_{t_i}^{t_{i+1}} \left( W_{t_i} + \frac{s - t_i}{t_{i+1}-t_i}(W_{t_{i+1}} - W_{t_i})\right)\;\mathrm{d}s \\
#     & = \frac{1}{2}\left(W_{t_i} + W_{t_{i+1}}\right)(t_{i+1} - t_i) + Z_i,
# \end{align*}
# ```
# where
# ```math
#     Z_i = \int_{t_i}^{t_{i+1}} B_s^i\;\mathrm{d}s.
# ```

# Notice the first term is the trapezoidal rule while the second term is a Gaussian with zero mean. We need to compute the variance of $Z_i$ to completely characterize it. By translation, it suffices to consider a Brownian bridge $\{B_t\}_{t\in [0, \tau]}$ on an interval $[0, \tau]$, with $\tau = \Delta t_N$. This is obtained from $B_t = W_t - (t/\tau)W_\tau$. We have, since $\mathbb{E}[W_tW_s] = \min\{t, s\}$, that
# ```math
#    \mathbb{E}[B_tB_s] = \min\{t, s\} - \frac{ts}{\tau}.
# ```
# Hence,
# ```math
# \begin{align*}
#     \mathbb{E}\left[\left(\int_0^{\tau} B_s\;\mathrm{d}s\right)^2\right] & = \mathbb{E}\left[\int_0^{\tau} \int_0^\tau B_sB_t\;\mathrm{d}s\;\mathrm{d}\right] \\
#     & = \int_0^\tau \int_0^\tau \mathbb{E}[B_sB_t] \;\mathrm{d}s\;\mathrm{d}t \\
#     & = \int_0^\tau \int_0^\tau \left(\min\{t, s\} - \frac{ts}{\tau}\right) \;\mathrm{d}s\;\mathrm{d}t  \\
#     & = \int_0^\tau \int_0^t s\;\mathrm{d}s\;\mathrm{d}t + \int_0^\tau \int_t^\tau t\;\mathrm{d}s\;\mathrm{d}t - \int_0^\tau \int_0^\tau \frac{ts}{\tau} \;\mathrm{d}s\;\mathrm{d}t \\
#     & = \int_0^\tau \frac{t^2}{2}\;\mathrm{d}t + \int_0^\tau t(\tau - t)\;\mathrm{d}t - \int_0^\tau \frac{t\tau^2}{2\tau}\;\mathrm{d}t \\
#     & = \frac{\tau^3}{12}.
# \end{align*}
# ```
# 
# Back to $Z_i$, this means that
# ```math
#     Z_i \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{(t_{i+1}- t_i)^3}{12}\right) = \sqrt{\frac{(t_{i+1} - t_i)^3}{12}}\mathcal{N}(0, 1).
# ```
# 
# For a normal variable $N \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma)$, the expectation of the random variable $e^N$ is $\mathbb{E}[e^N] = e^{\mu + \sigma^2/2}$. Hence,
# ```math
#     \mathbb{E}[e^{Z_i}] = e^{((t_{i+1}- t_i)^3)/24}.
# ```
# This is the contribution of this random variable to the mean of the exact solution. But in the implementation we actually draw from $Z_i$, not from $e^{Z_i}$.
#
# Another way is to use the result in Section 14.2 of [Han & Kloeden 2017](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-10-6265-0), which says that the the exact distribution of $\int_0^\tau W_s\;\mathrm{d}s$ given the step $\Delta W = W_\tau - W_0 = W_\tau$, is
# ```math
# \int_0^{\tau} W_s\;\mathrm{d}s \sim \frac{\tau}{2}\Delta W + \sqrt{\frac{\tau^3}{12}}\mathcal{N}(0, 1) = \frac{\tau}{2}\Delta W + \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{\tau^3}{12}\right).
# ```
#
# Then, for the distribution of the integral over a mesh interval $[t_i, t_{i+1}]$ when given the endpoints $W_{t_i}$ and $W_{t_{i+1}},$ we use that $s \mapsto W_{t_i+s} - W_{t_i}$ is a standard Wiener process to find that
# ```math
# \begin{align*}
# \int_{t_i}^{t_{i+1}} W_s\;\mathrm{d}s & = W_{t_i} + \int_{t_i}^{t_{i+1}} (W_s - W_{t_i})\;\mathrm{d}s \\
# & = W_{t_i}(t_{i+1} - t_i) + \int_{0}^{t_{i+1} - t_i} (W_{t_i+s} - W_{t_i})\;\mathrm{d}s \\
# & = W_{t_i}(t_{i+1} - t_i) + \frac{(t_{i+1} - t_i)}{2}(W_{t_{i+1}}-W_{t_{i}}) + Z_i \\
# & = \frac{(W_{t_{i+1}}+W_{t_{i}})}{2}(t_{i+1} - t_i) + Z_i,
# \end{align*}
# ```
# where $Z_i$ is as above. Thus, breaking down the sum over the mesh intervals:
# ```math
# \int_0^{t_j} W_s\;\mathrm{d}s = \sum_{i = 0}^{j-1} \int_{t_i}^{t_{i+1}} W_s\;\mathrm{d}s = \sum_{i=0}^{j-1} \left( \frac{(W_{t_{i+1}}+W_{t_{i}})}{2}(t_{i+1} - t_i) + Z_i\right).
# ```
#
# In any case, once an Euler approximation is computed, along with realizations $\{W_{t_i}\}_{i=0}^n$ of a sample path of the noise, we consider an exact sample solution given by
# ```math
#     X_{t_j} = X_0 e^{\sum_{i = 0}^{j-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\left(W_{t_i} + W_{t_{i+1}}\right)(t_{i+1} - t_i) + Z_i\right)},
# ```
# for realizations $Z_i$ drawn from a normal distribution and scaled by the standard deviation $\sqrt{(t_{i+1} - t_i)^3/12}$. This is implemented by computing the integral recursively, via
# ```math
#     \begin{cases}
#         I_j = I_{j-1} + \frac{1}{2}\left(W_{t_{j-1}} + W_{t_j}\right)(t_{j} - t_{j-1}) + Z_j, \\
#         Z_j = \sqrt{\frac{(t_{j} - t_{j-1})^3}{12}} R_j, \\
#         R_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1), \\
#     \end{cases}
# ```
# with $I_0 = 0$, and setting
# ```math
#   X_{t_j} = X_0 e^{I_j}.
# ```
# 
# ## Numerical approximation
# 
# ### Setting up the problem
# 
# First we load the necessary packages

using Plots
using Random
using Distributions
using RODEConvergence

# Then we set up some variables, starting by choosing the `Xoshiro256++` pseudo-random number generator, and setting its seed for the sake of reproducibility:

rng = Xoshiro(123)
nothing # hide

# We set the right hand side of the equation:

f(t, x, y, p) = y * x
nothing # hide

# Next we set up the time interval and the initial distribution law for the initial value problem, which we take it to be a [Distributions.Normal](https://juliastats.org/Distributions.jl/latest/univariate/#Distributions.Normal) random variable:

t0, tf = 0.0, 1.0
x0law = Normal()

# The noise is a [`WienerProcess`](@ref) starting at ``y_0 = 0``:

y0 = 0.0
noise = WienerProcess(t0, tf, y0)

# There is no parameter in the equation, so we just set `params` to `nothing`.

params = nothing

# The number of mesh points for the target solution and the approximations

ntgt = 2^16
ns = 2 .^ (4:14)

# and for a visualization of one of the sample approximations

nsample = ns[[1, 2, 3, 4]]

# Finally, we set up the number of samples for the Monte Carlo estimate of the strong error:

m = 1200
nothing # hide

# and add some information about the simulation, for the caption of the convergence figure.

info = (
    equation = "\$\\mathrm{d}X_t/\\mathrm{d}t = W_t X_t\$",
    noise = "a standard Wiener process noise \$\\{W_t\\}_t\$",
    ic = "\$X_0 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\$"
)
nothing # hide

# The *target* solution as described above is implemented as

target_solver! = function (xt::Vector{T}, t0::T, tf::T, x0::T, f::F, yt::Vector{T}, params::Q, rng::AbstractRNG) where {T, F, Q}
    axes(xt) == axes(yt) || throw(
        DimensionMismatch("The vectors `xt` and `yt` must match indices")
    )

    n = size(xt, 1)
    dt = (tf - t0) / (n - 1)
    i1 = firstindex(xt)
    xt[i1] = x0
    integral = zero(T)
    zscale = sqrt(dt^3 / 12)
    for i in Iterators.drop(eachindex(xt, yt), 1)
        integral += (yt[i] + yt[i1]) * dt / 2 + zscale * randn(rng)
        xt[i] = x0 * exp(integral)
        i1 = i
    end
end
nothing # hide

# and with that we construct the [`CustomMethod`](@ref) that solves the problem with this `target_solver!`:

target = CustomUnivariateMethod(target_solver!, rng)
nothing # hide

# The method for which we want to estimate the rate of convergence is, naturally, the Euler method, denoted [`RandomEuler`](@ref):

method = RandomEuler()

# ### Order of convergence

# With all the parameters set up, we build the [`ConvergenceSuite`](@ref):       

suite = ConvergenceSuite(t0, tf, x0law, f, noise, params, target, method, ntgt, ns, m)

# Then we are ready to compute the errors via [`solve`](@ref):

@time result = solve(rng, suite)
nothing # hide

# The computed strong error for each resolution in `ns` is stored in `result.errors`, and a raw LaTeX table can be displayed for inclusion in the article:
# 

table = generate_error_table(result, suite, info)

println(table) # hide
nothing # hide
 
# The calculated order of convergence is given by `result.p`:

println("Order of convergence `C Δtᵖ` with p = $(round(result.p, sigdigits=2)) and 95% confidence interval ($(round(result.pmin, sigdigits=3)), $(round(result.pmax, sigdigits=3)))")
nothing # hide

# 
# 
# ### Plots
# 
# We create a plot with the rate of convergence with the help of a plot recipe for `ConvergenceResult`:

plt = plot(result)

#

savefig(plt, joinpath(@__DIR__() * "../../../../latex/img/order_wiener_linearhomogenous.pdf")) # hide
nothing # hide

# For the sake of illustration, we plot the approximations of a sample target solution:

plt = plot(suite, ns=nsample)

#

savefig(plt, joinpath(@__DIR__() * "../../../../latex/img/approximation_linearhomogenous.pdf")) # hide
nothing # hide

# Finally, we also visualize the noise associated with this sample solution:

plot(suite, xshow=false, yshow=true, label="Wiener noise")
